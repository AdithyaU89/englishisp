# Hello!

This is a collection of the code I used to solve a few challenges in [PicoCTF](https://play.picoctf.org/events/72), a cybersecurity competition run by Carnegie Mellon. 
These challenges exemplify my ability to problem-solve using Python, as well as deal with websites, ports, and automation.
