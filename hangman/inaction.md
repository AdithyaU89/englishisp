This is a little game I made to demonstrate my evergrowing understanding of the nuances of Python. This hangman rendition I coded has a set list of words to pull from. 
After pulling from that list: `words_to_guess`, the game calculates the length of the word and displays that many `_` to guess from. Then, it's simple: let the user guess!
I hope you have fun playing!
