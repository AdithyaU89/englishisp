This is a collection of all the code I have made in the duration of my ISP. Along with my main product I have included various other scripts I have coded for various purposes, including code I used to solve challenges in PicoCTF as well as other Cybersecurity competitions. Due to having many "products" as a result of me learning Python for my ISP, I had no "true" end product. However, to satisfy the requirements of the project as well as mae a sort of proof of concept for my ISP, I decided I would code a simple game of my choosing in Python.
